"""UAV policies.

A policy receives one Observation per UAV, describing only what that UAV can see, and returns one Action per
UAV: a direction and a speed, for example Action(ACTION_UP, 3) to fly three cells north. WildFireModel calls
it once per time step, in step().

To add your own policy:

  1. write specs/policies/my-policy.md, named after the policy, saying what it is required to do.
     specs/README.md is the authoring contract; a registered policy with no specification fails
     `python3 tools/trace.py check`
  2. create sim/policy/my_policy.py with a Policy subclass that has a unique 'name' and implements
     select_actions(observations)
  3. import it below and add the class to the REGISTERED tuple
  4. mark the tests that demonstrate each requirement with @pytest.mark.verifies("POL-...")

It is then available as `python3 headless.py --policy my-policy`, and appears in the dropdown on the web
interface without any further change. The obligations in specs/policies/_contract.md come for free: the
contract suite in tests/policy/test_policy_interface.py is parametrised over REGISTERED.
