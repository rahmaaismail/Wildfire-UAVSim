# =====================================================================================================
# # Wildfire-UAVSim configuration
#
# Every simulation setting lives in this file. Each entry below is written as
#
#     ### `NAME` -- what it does
#     **Bounds:** which values are legal
#
# and the sections follow the order a run is built up in: the environment first, then the forest, the
# ignition, the wind and the smoke, the UAVs, the optional fuel, firefighting and positioning error
# extensions, the managing system, and finally the drawing colours. Nothing else belongs here: the shared
# maths that reads these settings lives in sim/formulas.py, which leaves this file as the settings alone.
#
# Any of these can also be overridden for a single run from the command line, without editing this file:
#
#     python3 headless.py --set DENSITY_PROB=0.6 --set 'FIRE_START_POSITION=(3, 3)'
#
# The bounds are stated but hardly ever enforced: a value outside them usually still runs, and quietly
# gives nonsense. The few that raise are called out individually.
#
# ## The defaults are calibrated, and six of them together
#
# `WIDTH`, `HEIGHT`, `BATCH_SIZE`, `FIRE_SPREAD_SPEED`, `BHP` and the two `WATER_EXTINGUISH_PROB_*` are
# not independent preferences. They were chosen together so that an unmanaged `firefighter` team saves the
# home base in about a tenth of its runs -- hard, but a scenario a policy can still win, which is what
# leaves a self-adaptive managing system something to demonstrate. Measured over 1000 seeds the team was
# never asked to fly: firefighter 10.9%, defend-base 19.6%, follow-fire and random 0%, and firefighter
# under the heuristic managing system 17.5%.
#
# Changing one of the six moves the win rate, sometimes a long way and not always in the direction it
# looks like it should -- a *larger* grid and a *stronger* wind both make the scenario easier. Move them
# with `tools/sweep.py`, which measures a configuration rather than guessing at it, and see the tuning
# section of README.md for the whole surface.
# =====================================================================================================

import random

# =====================================================================================================
# ## Random number source
# =====================================================================================================

# ### `SYSTEM_RANDOM` -- the generator every stochastic decision in the simulator draws from.
# Replacing it with a seeded generator, as `headless.py` and the test fixtures do, makes a run
# reproducible. `headless.py` always replaces it, drawing a base seed from OS entropy and reporting it
# when `--seed` was not given, so a batch is independent of every other batch and still replayable
# afterwards. Only the web interface leaves the value below in place. Because this is a module
# attribute, seeding is process-global: a batch may be parallelised across processes but not threads,
# which `headless.py` enforces.
# **Bounds:** a `random.Random` instance. `random.SystemRandom()` is not available on all systems.
SYSTEM_RANDOM = random.SystemRandom()

# =====================================================================================================
# ## Environment switches
#
# What the simulated world contains. Read all over the project, so best left alone once a run has begun.
# =====================================================================================================

# ### `ACTIVATE_WIND` -- whether wind skews the direction the fire spreads in.
# With it off, `MU`, `WIND_DIRECTION` and `WIND_VARIABILITY` are ignored. An empty `WIND_DIRECTION` says the
# same thing, so there are two ways to ask for a still day; this one exists so that a sweep can switch the
# wind off with `--set ACTIVATE_WIND=False` without having to discard, and later restore, the direction list.
# **Bounds:** `True` / `False`.
ACTIVATE_WIND = True

# ### `ACTIVATE_SMOKE` -- whether burning cells raise smoke, which drifts downwind and blinds observers.
# The master switch for the whole of the `## Smoke` section below. With it off no cell ever smokes, nothing
# is drawn over the fire, and no observation is obscured. It still has no part in how the fire spreads:
# smoke is a condition on what can be *seen*, not on what burns.
# **Bounds:** `True` / `False`.
ACTIVATE_SMOKE = True

# ### `PROBABILITY_MAP` -- draw each cell's probability of catching fire instead of the forest.
# **Bounds:** `True` / `False`. Requires `NUM_AGENTS = 0`: nothing but the fire is drawn on the
# probability map, so a UAV would get a portrayal with no "Layer" attribute out of `portrayal_method(obj)`
# and the canvas would throw `KeyError: 'Layer'`.
PROBABILITY_MAP = False

# =====================================================================================================
# ## Forest area
#
# How large the map is, and how much there is to burn on it.
# =====================================================================================================

# ### `BATCH_SIZE` -- how long a run lasts, in simulation steps.
# The web interface shows `Done` once it is reached.
# This is the single strongest difficulty setting there is, which is easy to miss because it does not
# sound like one. A run is won by surviving to the end of it with the base still standing, and a wildfire
# on a 100x100 map is never actually put out -- so given long enough, every run is lost. Holding the rest
# of the defaults still: 10% of runs won at 100 steps, 4.2% at 125, 2.5% at 150, 0.5% at 200 and none at
# all by 300. `100` is a calibrated value, not a free one.
# This is the only run length there is: the model stops itself when its own `BATCH_SIZE` is reached, so
# `headless.py --steps N` is an alias for `--set BATCH_SIZE=N` and passing both a different value is an
# error. It was once a separate count of runner iterations, which quietly did nothing above `BATCH_SIZE`
# and scored a run truncated below it as won -- see the note in `sim/cli/main.py`.
# **Bounds:** integer `>= 1`.
BATCH_SIZE = 100

# ### `WIDTH`, `HEIGHT` -- grid size (forest area size), in cells.
# The web canvas is drawn at 10 pixels per cell, so a grid much past ~100 stops fitting on screen.
# Beware that grid size is not the difficulty dial it looks like. `FIRE_START_POSITION` draws uniformly
# over the map, so on a larger grid the fire usually ignites further from the base: at the shipped
# `FIRE_SPREAD_SPEED = 2` a firefighter team won 37% of runs at 50x50 and 80% at 150x150. The default
# spread speed below is fast enough that the fire crosses the map either way, which is what makes the
# size roughly independent of the difficulty now (5% at 50x50, 10% at 100x100, 12.5% at 150x150).
# **Bounds:** integers `>= 1`. Run time grows with `WIDTH * HEIGHT`.
WIDTH = 100  # in python [height, width] for grid, in js [width, heigh]
HEIGHT = 100

# ### `FUEL_UPPER_LIMIT`, `FUEL_BOTTOM_LIMIT` -- burnable fuel each cell starts with.
# Every cell draws uniformly from the inclusive range, and burns for that many fire updates.
# **Bounds:** integers, `1 <= FUEL_BOTTOM_LIMIT <= FUEL_UPPER_LIMIT`. `FUEL_UPPER_LIMIT` also scales the
# vegetation and fire colour ramps, so it must stay `> 0`.
FUEL_UPPER_LIMIT = 10
FUEL_BOTTOM_LIMIT = 5

# ### `BURNING_RATE` -- fuel a burning cell loses per fire update.
# Larger means cells burn out sooner, so the fire front is thinner and moves on faster.
# **Bounds:** integer `>= 1`. Anything past `FUEL_UPPER_LIMIT` burns every cell out in a single update.
BURNING_RATE = 1

# ### `FIRE_SPREAD_SPEED` -- simulation steps between fire updates, so larger means slower spread.
# Everything else (UAVs, water drops, the immunity countdown) still runs every step.
# `1` rather than `2` because the default grid is 100x100: at `2` the fire is frozen every other step and
# frequently never reaches the base at all, which decides the run by where the ignition landed rather than
# by how the team flew. It is the strongest single dial on difficulty -- on its own it takes a firefighter
# team from 65% of runs won to 32%.
# **Bounds:** integer `>= 1`, where `1` is the fastest spread available. `0` raises `ZeroDivisionError`,
# and a fraction never satisfies the integer modulo in `Fire.step()`, which freezes the fire entirely.
FIRE_SPREAD_SPEED = 1

# ### `DENSITY_PROB` -- share of the grid covered by vegetation (tree density).
# Each cell independently gets a Fire agent with this probability; a cell without one never burns.
# **Bounds:** float in `[0, 1]`. `1` is a fully wooded map, `0` an empty one bar the ignition cell.
DENSITY_PROB = 0.9

# =====================================================================================================
# ## Ignition
#
# Where and when the initial wildfire starts; either can be fixed or randomised. The cell and step that
# get resolved are logged when the model is built, shown in the sidebar of the web interface, and
# recorded by `headless.py` as `fire_start_pos` and `fire_start_step`.
# =====================================================================================================

# ### `FIRE_START_POSITION` -- the cell the fire starts from.
# The ignition cell always holds a Fire agent whatever `DENSITY_PROB` decides, so the fire has somewhere
# to start even on a sparse map.
# **Bounds:** one of
#   None      -> the centre of the grid
#   "random"  -> a uniformly random cell, avoiding the home base footprint
#   (x, y)    -> that exact cell, which must lie inside the grid
FIRE_START_POSITION = "random"

# ### `FIRE_START_STEP` -- the simulation step the fire is lit at.
# Step 0 is the state the model is built in, so a fire lit at step 0 is already burning before the first
# step is taken. Until that step nothing burns: the UAVs fly, MR2 accumulates, and MR1 stays at zero.
# **Bounds:** one of
#   an int    -> exactly that step, >= 0. A value >= BATCH_SIZE is warned about and never lights
#   (a, b)    -> a random step drawn uniformly from the inclusive range [a, b], with 0 <= a <= b
#   "random"  -> a random step anywhere in the run, [0, BATCH_SIZE)
FIRE_START_STEP = (10, 20)

# =====================================================================================================
# ## Wind
#
# Ignored unless `ACTIVATE_WIND` is True.
#
# One wind blows over the whole grid at any instant, from the 8 point compass.
# It raises the chance of the fire spreading along the one ray pointing downwind, and
# lowers it everywhere else, by a fraction `MU`.
#
# A direction names where the wind blows *toward*, with y increasing north: 'EAST' pushes the fire toward
# larger x, 'SOUTH' toward smaller y. So under an easterly the cell that lights you is the one to your
# west. That is worth reading twice, because meteorology names a wind for where it comes *from* and this
# does not.
#
# The wind is drawn from `WIND_DIRECTION` and held for `WIND_VARIABILITY` steps before being drawn again,
# which makes a fixed wind, a wind randomised once per run, and a wind that wanders all the same setting
# at different values:
#
#     WIND_DIRECTION = ['SOUTH']                    a southerly, all run, every run
#     WIND_DIRECTION = [...], WIND_VARIABILITY = None   one direction per run, drawn at reset
#     WIND_DIRECTION = [...], WIND_VARIABILITY = 20     turning every 20 steps
#     WIND_DIRECTION = []                           no wind, the same as ACTIVATE_WIND = False
#
# This replaced a pair of settings, FIRST_DIR and SECOND_DIR, mixed by a FIRST_DIR_PROB drawn afresh for
# every cell and every neighbour of it. That gave a diagonal wind only in aggregate -- no cell ever felt
# one, and neighbouring cells felt the wind blowing different ways at the same instant, which is not a
# thing a wind does. The diagonals here are directions in their own right.
# =====================================================================================================

# ### `WIND_DIRECTION` -- the directions the wind may blow, drawn from uniformly.
# A single entry is a wind that never varies, whatever `WIND_VARIABILITY` says, and costs no randomness.
# **Bounds:** a list of names from `WIND_DIRECTIONS` below -- 'NORTH', 'NORTH_EAST', 'EAST', 'SOUTH_EAST',
# 'SOUTH', 'SOUTH_WEST', 'WEST', 'NORTH_WEST'. Case is not significant. `None` or `[]` means no wind.
# A bare string is taken as a list of one, so `--set WIND_DIRECTION=SOUTH` does what it looks like.
WIND_DIRECTION = ['NORTH', 'SOUTH']

# ### `WIND_VARIABILITY` -- how many simulation steps the wind holds a direction before drawing again.
# Counted in the same steps as `BATCH_SIZE`, not in fire updates, so `FIRE_SPREAD_SPEED` does not scale it:
# the smoke drifts on this clock too, and the smoke has no other use for the fire's.
# **Bounds:** an integer `>= 1`, or `None` for a wind drawn once at reset and held for the whole run.
# A value `>= BATCH_SIZE` amounts to the same thing as `None`.
WIND_VARIABILITY = 10

# ### `MU` -- how hard the wind leans on the fire.
# Not a wind speed, despite the name: it is the *contrast* between downwind and everywhere else, and it is
# one number doing both halves of that job. A burning neighbour at offset (dx, dy) influences a cell by
# `w = distance ** -2` (`distance_rate()` below), which the wind then moves:
#
#     on the downwind ray:  w  ->  w + MU * (1 - w)      a fraction MU of the way to certainty
#     everywhere else:      w  ->  w * (1 - MU)          shrunk by a fraction MU
#
# "Everywhere else" is everything not exactly on the ray -- crosswind and the two flanking diagonals are
# suppressed just as hard as upwind is.
# **Bounds:** float in `[0, 1]`. `0` makes the wind irrelevant. `1` makes it absolute: the cell one step
# downwind ignites with certainty and no other cell ever ignites at all, so the fire becomes a line one
# cell wide. At the shipped `0.5`, over the spread radius of 3:
#
#     SOUTH ray                        SOUTH_EAST ray
#      (0, 1)  d=1.00  w 1.00 -> 1.00   (-1, 1)  d=1.41  w 0.50 -> 0.75
#      (0, 2)  d=2.00  w 0.25 -> 0.63   (-2, 2)  d=2.83  w 0.13 -> 0.56
#      (0, 3)  d=3.00  w 0.11 -> 0.56   (-3, 3)  d=4.24  outside the radius
#
# A diagonal ray reaches one ring less than a cardinal one, because its third cell falls outside the
# radius, and its nearest cell is not a certainty. That asymmetry is deliberate and left alone: a diagonal
# step covers 1.41 cells, so the two come out close in front speed (0.75 * 1.41 = 1.06 against 1.00),
# and the alternative -- widening the downwind set into a cone -- would change cardinal spread as well and
# invalidate every calibrated number in this file.
MU = 0.9

# =====================================================================================================
# ## Smoke
#
# Ignored unless `ACTIVATE_SMOKE` is True. A cell raises smoke a while after it catches fire, and that
# smoke then hangs about for as many steps as the cell had fuel. That cell is the *source*; the smoke
# itself blows downwind from it, over ground that may never burn at all, and a cell the plume covers
# cannot be observed -- not its fire, not its vegetation, not the UAVs or out buildings standing on it.
#
# Two knobs shape the plume, and they are deliberately independent of the wind the fire feels. Smoke is a
# suspended thing with no fuel to hold it in place, so it goes where the air goes: `SMOKE_MU` is meant to
# sit above `MU` and `SMOKE_DRIFT_RADIUS` above the fire's spread radius of 3, which together make the
# plume both longer and far more one sided than anything the fire could reach. See sim/smoke.py.
# =====================================================================================================

# ### `SMOKE_PRE_DISPELLING_COUNTER` -- steps between a cell catching fire and its smoke appearing.
# The smoke then lasts for the cell's initial fuel, set as `self.dispelling_counter_start_value` in
# `Smoke.__init__()` in `sim/environment.py`. Keep the sum of the two above `FUEL_UPPER_LIMIT`, or the smoke
# clears before the cell has finished burning.
# **Bounds:** integer `>= 0`, where `0` raises smoke the moment the cell ignites.
SMOKE_PRE_DISPELLING_COUNTER = 2

# ### `SMOKE_OCCLUDES_OBSERVATION` -- whether smoke blinds the observers, or is only drawn.
# Separate from `ACTIVATE_SMOKE` on purpose, and the switch to reach for rather than that one. Turning it
# off leaves the smoke on the canvas and takes it out of the observation pipeline entirely, which is both
# the control arm for a sweep over the settings below and the way to reproduce a result recorded before
# smoke did anything. It is the single strongest dial on observability there is: measured over 200 paired
# runs of an unmanaged firefighter team under a fixed southerly wind, it takes MR1 from 16.8 to 5.4 and
# the win rate from 11.5% to 1.0%, and leaves 24% more of the map alight at the end.
# It also breaks deconfliction, because a team mate under smoke is missing from `uav_positions` and
# `Observation.occupied()` then calls its cell clear. Do not expect that to show up as more collisions:
# a blinded firefighter has nothing to fly at and holds position, and the same runs above collide *less*
# (2.10 against 2.51) for that reason. Fewer collisions here means a team doing nothing.
# **Bounds:** `True` / `False`. Ignored when `ACTIVATE_SMOKE` is False, since there is then no smoke to see
# through.
SMOKE_OCCLUDES_OBSERVATION = False

# ### `SMOKE_MU` -- wind strength for the smoke, the analogue of `MU` for the fire.
# The fraction of the remaining density that blowing downwind adds, and blowing crosswind or upwind takes
# away. Meant to sit above `MU`: the point of the extension is that smoke is carried further by the same
# wind than the fire is. That ordering is documented rather than validated, because two independent knobs
# that a sweep has to be able to take past each other should not be wired together.
# **Bounds:** float in `[0, 1]`. `0` makes the plume a symmetric blob around the source, `1` collapses it
# onto the downwind axis alone.
SMOKE_MU = 0.9

# ### `SMOKE_DRIFT_RADIUS` -- how far a plume reaches from its source, in cells.
# Independent of the fire's spread radius of 3, and worth keeping above it, or a plume never covers ground
# the fire could not have reached on its own and the extension has little to say. The cost is one shifted
# add per offset per step, so it grows with the square of this: `6` is roughly three times the per step
# cost of the fire's own convolution, which is not much next to the rest of a step.
# **Bounds:** integer `>= 0`, where `0` leaves each source cell obscuring only itself.
SMOKE_DRIFT_RADIUS = 6

# ### `SMOKE_OCCLUSION_THRESHOLD` -- the density at or above which a cell cannot be seen through.
# Smoke density is worked out for every cell as a weighted sum over the sources near it (see
# `sim/smoke.py`) and clipped into `[0, 1]`; this is where the cut is made. Lower means a wider plume,
# since thinner smoke at the edges starts to count.
# **Bounds:** float in `(0, 1]`. `0` would make every cell of the grid opaque for as long as anything is
# smoking anywhere, which is why it is excluded.
SMOKE_OCCLUSION_THRESHOLD = 0.5

# =====================================================================================================
# ## UAVs
#
# The team that flies over the forest area. `NUM_AGENTS = 0` simulates the wildfire on its own.
# =====================================================================================================

# ### `NUM_AGENTS` -- how many UAVs fly over the forest area.
# **Bounds:** integer `>= 0`, and no larger than `WIDTH * HEIGHT`, since the team launches unstacked.
# Must be `0` when `PROBABILITY_MAP` is True.
NUM_AGENTS = 8

# ### `N_ACTIONS` -- size of the movement action space a policy draws from.
# The four movement directions below are indices 0..3. Holding position and dumping water sit outside
# the space on purpose, so that the random baseline keeps drawing from the original four.
# **Bounds:** `4` (the default), or `5` to bring `ACTION_STAY` into the action space of a learning
# algorithm. `ACTION_DUMP_WATER` is only ever emitted by policies that opt into it.
N_ACTIONS = 4

# ### Action indices -- fixed constants, not tuning parameters. Do not renumber.
# They index the movement vectors in `UAV.move()`, and are what a policy returns from `select_actions()`.
ACTION_RIGHT = 0
ACTION_DOWN = 1
ACTION_LEFT = 2
ACTION_UP = 3
ACTION_STAY = 4         # hold position; deliberately outside N_ACTIONS
ACTION_DUMP_WATER = 5   # firefighting extension only; likewise outside N_ACTIONS

# ### `MOVEMENT_VECTORS` -- how far one cell of movement takes a UAV, per direction.
# `UAV.move()` flies along these, and a policy that has to work out where an action would land it reads
# the same table, so the two cannot drift apart. Fixed constants, not tuning parameters.
MOVEMENT_VECTORS = {
    ACTION_RIGHT: (1, 0),
    ACTION_DOWN: (0, -1),
    ACTION_LEFT: (-1, 0),
    ACTION_UP: (0, 1),
}

# ### `UAV_SPEED` -- the most cells a UAV can cover in one time step.
# A policy asks for a direction and a speed, and the UAV covers up to this many cells along that
# direction, stopping early at the edge of the grid or in front of another UAV.
# **Bounds:** integer `>= 0`. `1` gives the original one cell per step behaviour, `0` grounds the fleet.
UAV_SPEED = 5

# ### `UAV_OBSERVATION_RADIUS` -- how far a UAV sees, in cells.
# Not really a radius: the observed area is the square of side `2 * radius + 1` centred on the UAV.
# **Bounds:** integer `>= 0`. A radius below `UAV_SPEED` lets a UAV fly past what it can see, and so into
# teammates it was never told were there.
UAV_OBSERVATION_RADIUS = 4

# derived from the radius above; headless.py recomputes both when it overrides it
side = ((UAV_OBSERVATION_RADIUS * 2) + 1)
N_OBSERVATIONS = side * side

# ### `SECURITY_DISTANCE` -- the separation, in cells, that the UAV team is meant to keep.
# A **scoring heuristic only**: MR2 counts the pairs of UAVs that end a step closer than this to each
# other, which is a proxy for how much collision risk a policy accepts. It does not stop a UAV from
# flying anywhere, and it is not what decides whether two UAVs collided -- that is a matter of sharing a
# cell, see `UAV_HP` below.
# **Bounds:** number `>= 0`. `0` never scores; more than the grid diagonal scores every pair every step.
SECURITY_DISTANCE = 6

# ### `UAV_HP` -- health points each UAV starts the run with.
# Two or more UAVs that end a step on the same cell have collided, and each of them rolls for damage; a
# UAV whose health points reach zero is destroyed and takes no further part in the run. The home base is
# the one exception: any number of UAVs can sit on its footprint without colliding, which is what lets
# the whole team start and refill there.
# **Bounds:** integer `>= 1`. Set it high enough that collisions cost a policy something without ending
# its run outright, or to a very large number to study a fleet that cannot be destroyed.
UAV_HP = 3

# ### `UAV_COLLISION_DAMAGE_MEAN` -- average health points a collision costs one UAV.
# The damage is rolled once per UAV per collision and is either a whole health point or nothing at all,
# so health points stay whole numbers while the expected cost of a collision is this value:
#   1.0  -> a full health point every time, which is the default
#   0.25 -> one health point in four collisions on average, and three that do no harm
#   0.0  -> collisions are still counted and logged, but never damage anybody
# **Bounds:** float in `[0, 1]`. Anything outside it is clamped by `formulas.roll_collision_damage()`,
# because a collision can never cost more than one health point.
UAV_COLLISION_DAMAGE_MEAN = 1.0

# =====================================================================================================
# ## Fuel extension
#
# Optional. When `ACTIVATE_FUEL` is False no fuel is burned, tracked or reported, and the simulation
# behaves exactly as it did before the extension existed. When it is True every UAV burns fuel to stay
# in the air, and one that runs dry loses every health point it has left and is destroyed, exactly as a
# fatal collision destroys it.
#
# Note that "fuel" means two unrelated things in this project. The `FUEL_UPPER_LIMIT` and
# `FUEL_BOTTOM_LIMIT` in the forest area section above are how much a vegetation cell has left to burn.
# Everything in this section is the fuel in a UAV's tank, and the two never interact.
#
# Refuelling happens at the home base, so it needs `ACTIVATE_FIREFIGHTING` to be True as well. With fuel
# on and the firefighting extension off there is nowhere to refuel, which turns `UAV_FUEL` into a hard
# endurance limit on the whole run.
# =====================================================================================================

# ### `ACTIVATE_FUEL` -- master switch for the whole extension.
# **Bounds:** `True` / `False`.
ACTIVATE_FUEL = True

# ### `UAV_FUEL` -- units of fuel in a full tank, which is what every UAV starts the run with.
# What this buys depends on how the UAV is flown: at the defaults below, holding position costs 1 a step
# and cruising three cells a step costs about 6.2, so a 150 unit tank is either 150 steps of loitering or
# about 24 steps of cruising. Size it against `BATCH_SIZE` and the number of sorties a run should allow.
# **Bounds:** number `> 0`. A very large value studies a fleet that never runs dry.
#
# Note that a tank only lasts a run if the policy flying it ever goes home to refuel. `firefighter` does,
# because it reads `Observation.low_fuel()`, and comes back with fuel to spare; `random` and `follow-fire`
# do not, so they drain any tank and lose the whole fleet part way through the run, whatever this is set
# to. That is a property of those baselines rather than of the size of the tank.
UAV_FUEL = 800

# ### `UAV_FUEL_IDLE_BURN` -- fuel burned per step spent airborne, whatever the UAV did.
# Charged for holding position and for dumping water as well as for flying, so staying up costs
# something. A UAV parked on the home base footprint burns nothing at all: engines off.
# **Bounds:** number `>= 0`. `0` lets a UAV loiter for free, so only distance costs.
UAV_FUEL_IDLE_BURN = 1.0

# ### `UAV_FUEL_BURN_PER_CELL` -- fuel burned per cell of flight, before the speed penalty below.
# Charged on the cells actually covered, so a UAV stopped early by the edge of the grid or by another UAV
# only pays for the distance it really flew.
# **Bounds:** number `>= 0`. `0` makes movement free, leaving the idle burn as a pure clock.
UAV_FUEL_BURN_PER_CELL = 1.0

# ### `UAV_FUEL_SPEED_EXPONENT` -- how much harder each extra cell of speed is on the tank.
# The per cell cost is raised to this power, so above `1` covering ground quickly costs more than covering
# the same ground slowly, the way the power a real airframe draws climbs steeply with airspeed:
#   1.0 -> flat. Five cells cost five times one cell, whether flown in one step or five
#   1.5 -> the default. Five cells in one step cost 11.2, against 5.0 flown one cell at a time
#   2.0 -> harsh. Five cells in one step cost 25.0, so sprinting is a serious decision
# **Bounds:** number `>= 0`. Below `1` it rewards sprinting instead, which is not physical but is a
# legitimate thing to experiment with.
UAV_FUEL_SPEED_EXPONENT = 1.5

# ### `UAV_FUEL_WATER_PENALTY` -- how much more a UAV burns for the water it is carrying.
# The whole cost of the step, the idle burn included, is multiplied by `1 + this * load`, where `load` is
# the share of a full load aboard (`water / UAV_WATER_CAPACITY`). Carrying mass costs lift whether or not
# the UAV is going anywhere, so a loaded UAV holding station pays it too; one parked on the base still
# burns nothing, since the whole cost is zero there. At the default a UAV flies out to the fire 30% more
# expensively than it flies home empty, which is what makes a wasted sortie cost something.
#
# The payload is the one the UAV started the step with, so the step it dumps its load on is charged as
# loaded: it carried the water for the whole of that step. Needs `ACTIVATE_FIREFIGHTING` for there to be
# any water at all: without it every UAV is permanently empty and this changes nothing.
# **Bounds:** number `>= 0`. `0` makes water free to carry, which is how the extension behaved before this
# existed. `1` makes a full load double the cost of every step.
UAV_FUEL_WATER_PENALTY = 0.0

# ### `UAV_FUEL_RESERVE` -- the share of a tank at or below which a policy should turn for home.
# Advisory only: nothing in the simulation enforces it. `Observation.low_fuel()` reports it, and the
# `firefighter` policy breaks off whatever it is doing and flies back to the base once it is reached.
# **Bounds:** float in `[0, 1]`. `0` never warns, so a policy reading it flies until the tank is empty;
# `1` sends a UAV home the moment it is anything short of full.
UAV_FUEL_RESERVE = 0.1

# ### `BASE_REFUEL_STEPS` -- steps a UAV must spend at the base to fill its tank.
# Refuelling is not an action, and shares the refilling slot with water: a UAV standing on the base that
# wants either takes one of the `BASE_CAPACITY` slots, waits `max(BASE_REFILL_STEPS, BASE_REFUEL_STEPS)`
# steps, and gets both at once. Ignored unless `ACTIVATE_FUEL` is True.
# **Bounds:** integer `>= 1`. `0` behaves the same as `1`, as a refuel still takes the step it starts on.
BASE_REFUEL_STEPS = 2

# =====================================================================================================
# ## Firefighting extension
#
# Optional. When `ACTIVATE_FIREFIGHTING` is False every variable in this section is ignored and the
# simulation behaves exactly as it did before the extension existed. When it is True the simulation
# gains a home base, water carrying UAVs, extinguishing, re-ignition and out buildings.
# =====================================================================================================

# ### `ACTIVATE_FIREFIGHTING` -- master switch for the whole extension.
# **Bounds:** `True` / `False`.
ACTIVATE_FIREFIGHTING = True

# ### `BASE_POSITION` -- the cell the home base is anchored on, its bottom left corner.
# UAVs start here and come back to refill. The default deliberately avoids the centre, because that is
# where `set_fire_agents()` lights the initial fire by default: a base on top of the ignition cell would
# be alight from step 1 and the UAVs would put the wildfire out before it ever spread.
# **Bounds:** an `(x, y)` cell inside the grid, or `None` to place the base a quarter of the way in. A
# position outside the grid raises `ValueError`.
BASE_POSITION = None

# ### `BASE_SIZE` -- footprint of the base, in cells, as `(width, height)`.
# The whole footprint is drawn blue, burns, and can be refilled from. The team is spread over it at the
# start of a run, one UAV per cell in order, so the fleet is visible from the first step and does not
# launch on top of itself; a team that outnumbers the footprint spills into the rings around the base.
# **Bounds:** a pair of integers `>= 1`, clipped to the grid at the edges.
BASE_SIZE = (2, 2)

# ### `BHP` -- base health points: the run is lost once the base has burned for this many steps.
# The damage is cumulative rather than consecutive, because a burning cell goes out for a step when none
# of its neighbours are alight yet, so the base collects its damage over several visits from the fire.
# `4` is part of the difficulty calibration below, and is the value at which the win rate responds most
# gently to the strength of a water drop -- at `2` or `3` the scenario is close to unwinnable whatever the
# water does, and at `5` a small change in the water swings the win rate twice as far.
# **Bounds:** integer `>= 1`.
BHP = 4

# ### `BASE_REFILL_STEPS` -- steps a UAV must spend at the base to take on a load of water.
# Refilling is not an action: a UAV with an empty tank standing on the base starts refilling by itself.
# **Bounds:** integer `>= 1`. `0` behaves the same as `1`, as a refill still takes the step it starts on.
BASE_REFILL_STEPS = 1

# ### `BASE_CAPACITY` -- how many UAVs can refill at the same time.
# **Bounds:** integer `>= 1`. The default of `1` (which is the requirement) makes arrivals queue.
BASE_CAPACITY = 1

# ### `UAV_WATER_CAPACITY` -- loads of water a UAV can carry at once.
# **Bounds:** integer `>= 1`.
UAV_WATER_CAPACITY = 1

# ### `WATER_DROP_RADIUS` -- how far a water drop reaches around the cell it is dumped on, in cells.
# The drop covers a disc, so the corners of the surrounding square fall outside it.
# **Bounds:** integer `>= 0`, where `0` wets only the target cell.
WATER_DROP_RADIUS = 2

# ### `WATER_EXTINGUISH_PROB_CENTRE`, `WATER_EXTINGUISH_PROB_EDGE` -- how well a drop puts a fire out.
# The chance of extinguishing the cell the water is dumped on, and one at `WATER_DROP_RADIUS`. In between
# the probability falls off linearly with the distance; beyond the radius it is zero.
# These two are the fine dial the difficulty is calibrated on: with the grid, spread speed and `BHP`
# fixed, they are the only setting left that moves the win rate smoothly rather than in a cliff. They were
# scaled together from the original `0.95` / `0.60` -- keeping the shape of the falloff -- until an
# unmanaged firefighter team won about a tenth of its runs. `tools/sweep.py` sweeps the pair as one number
# under the name `EXTINGUISH_SCALE`; these values are that scale at `0.80`.
# **Bounds:** floats in `[0, 1]`, normally with centre `>=` edge. The reverse is allowed, and simply
# makes the drop stronger at its rim than under itself.
WATER_EXTINGUISH_PROB_CENTRE = 0.76
WATER_EXTINGUISH_PROB_EDGE = 0.48

# ### `REIGNITION_DELAY` -- steps an extinguished cell is immune to catching fire again.
# Once the delay has passed, nearby fire can light the cell as usual.
# **Bounds:** integer `>= 0`, where `0` lets a cell relight the step after it was doused.
REIGNITION_DELAY = 8

# ### `SPONTANEOUS_REIGNITION_PROB` -- per step chance an extinguished cell relights on its own.
# Applies with no fire nearby, to any cell that was extinguished at some point and still has fuel.
# **Bounds:** float in `[0, 1]`. Keep it low: it is rolled for every such cell on every step.
SPONTANEOUS_REIGNITION_PROB = 0.005

# ### `NUM_OUT_BUILDINGS` -- out buildings scattered over the map, which burn and are worth protecting.
# Never placed on the home base. If more are asked for than there are free cells, only what fits is placed.
# **Bounds:** integer `>= 0`.
NUM_OUT_BUILDINGS = 0

# ### `OUT_BUILDING_HP` -- steps an out building survives while its cell burns, before it is destroyed.
# **Bounds:** integer `>= 1`.
OUT_BUILDING_HP = 5

# =====================================================================================================
# ## Positioning error extension
#
# Optional. When `ACTIVATE_POSITION_ERROR` is False nothing here is drawn, applied or reported, and the
# simulation behaves exactly as it did before the extension existed -- including the sequence of draws it
# takes from `SYSTEM_RANDOM`, so every seeded result in the project is unchanged by this section existing.
#
# When it is True a UAV no longer knows exactly where it is. The grid still does. Mesa's position is the
# ground truth: it is what the UAV actually flies from, what collisions are settled from, what fuel is
# charged against, what the home base serves, and what MR1 and MR2 are scored on. What the error corrupts
# is the *measurement* -- the position the UAV believes it has, which is the position its policy plans
# from, the position the team mates that can see it are told, and the position the managing system is
# shown. Nothing about the world changes; only what is believed about it. That is what keeps a run with
# the extension on comparable with one without it: both are scored on where the UAVs really were.
#
# The error of one UAV on one step is a fixed bias plus per step noise, in cells, per axis:
#
#     offset = bias(uav) + noise(uav, step)
#
# The bias is drawn once when the UAV is created and held for the whole run, which is a receiver that was
# never calibrated: that airframe is consistently a couple of cells off, in the same direction, all run.
# The noise is redrawn every step, which is the jitter of a fix taken again from scratch each time. Setting
# either magnitude to 0 switches that component off and leaves the other one working.
#
# Only the UAV's own position is corrupted. What it *sees* -- the burning cells, the base footprint, the
# out buildings -- stays in true grid coordinates, because a positioning error is a property of the
# receiver and not of the camera. It also has to be that way for the extension to do anything at all:
# every policy steers by the difference between where it thinks it is and where the target is, so
# displacing both by the same offset would cancel the error out exactly and no UAV would fly anywhere new.
#
# The measured position is clamped into the grid, so it is always a legal cell however large the error is
# set; a UAV near an edge therefore reports the edge more often than the arithmetic alone would.
#
# What a run with it on is expected to show, none of which is a defect in it:
#   * more collisions. A policy trims its flight against positions that are wrong, and the deconfliction
#     in `SuperPolicy` reserves cells in one UAV's frame and subtracts them in another's, so the team no
#     longer really keeps itself apart
#   * UAVs that circle a fire without ever being over it, because the offset never lets them close
#   * with the firefighting extension on, UAVs that believe they are standing on the home base when they
#     are not. Such a UAV holds position off the pad waiting to be refilled by a base that cannot see it,
#     and with the fuel extension on it eventually runs dry there. Losing a fleet that way is the
#     extension working, and it is the most interesting thing a managing system could learn to detect
# =====================================================================================================

# ### `ACTIVATE_POSITION_ERROR` -- master switch for the whole extension.
# **Bounds:** `True` / `False`.
ACTIVATE_POSITION_ERROR = False

# ### `UAV_POSITION_BIAS_MAX` -- largest fixed positioning error a UAV can carry, in cells per axis.
# Each UAV draws its own bias when it is created, uniformly from the integers in
# `[-UAV_POSITION_BIAS_MAX, +UAV_POSITION_BIAS_MAX]` on each axis, and keeps it for the whole run. So this
# is the spread of a fleet of receivers of varying quality rather than one error the whole team shares.
# **Bounds:** integer `>= 0`. `0` gives every UAV a perfectly calibrated receiver, leaving the per step
# noise below as the only error. Values approaching the grid size are legal, but spend most of their range
# against the clamp.
UAV_POSITION_BIAS_MAX = 0

# ### `UAV_POSITION_NOISE_MAX` -- largest per step positioning jitter, in cells per axis.
# Renewed for every UAV on every step, uniformly from the integers in
# `[-UAV_POSITION_NOISE_MAX, +UAV_POSITION_NOISE_MAX]` on each axis, and added to that UAV's bias. One fix
# serves the whole step: the policy, the managing system and the status panel are shown one and the same
# position, because the three of them disagreeing about where a UAV was at one instant would be an artefact
# of the implementation rather than an error the UAV could have made. The jitter is worked out from the UAV
# and the step number rather than drawn from `SYSTEM_RANDOM`, so that asking a UAV where it thinks it is has
# no effect on the run -- which is what lets the web interface show it while a simulation is being watched.
# **Bounds:** integer `>= 0`. `0` leaves the bias as the only error, which is the case worth starting
# from: the fleet is wrong, but each UAV is wrong in the same way on every step.
UAV_POSITION_NOISE_MAX = 1

# =====================================================================================================
# ## Managing system (MAPE-K)
#
# Optional. The simulation on its own is a *managed system*: every UAV flies one policy, chosen before the
# run starts and never revisited. Setting `MANAGING_SYSTEM` to anything but `none` adds a *managing system*
# over it, which decides at runtime which policy each UAV should be flying, so as to keep the home base
# standing and keep the team from flying into itself.
#
# It is built as a MAPE-K loop (Monitor, Analyse, Plan, Execute over a shared Knowledge base) and lives in
# `sim/managing/`. It never touches the simulation directly: it reads through a *sensor* and writes through
# an *effector*, both defined in `sim/managing/ports.py` and implemented in `sim/adapters.py`. Nothing in
# `sim/managing/` imports the model, the agents or mesa, and a test enforces that.
#
# With it switched off, `AdaptiveWildFireModel` behaves exactly like the plain `WildFireModel`: every
# setting below is ignored and the whole team flies whichever single policy was selected.
# =====================================================================================================

# ### `MANAGING_SYSTEM` -- which managing system runs over the simulation.
#
# A managing system is one named combination of the five MAPE-K components, and they are registered in
# `sim/managing/systems.py`, where `python3 headless.py --list-managing` will print them. As they stand:
#
#   * `'none'`      -- no managing system. Every UAV flies the one policy the model was given, for the
#                      whole run, exactly as the simulator behaved before any of this existed. The
#                      unmanaged baseline a managed run is compared against.
#   * `'static'`    -- the loop runs but never reallocates. The control arm: it separates what `SuperPolicy`
#                      is worth from what adapting is worth, which `'none'` cannot.
#   * `'heuristic'` -- the default. Rules over threat to the base and crowding, damped by hysteresis.
#   * `'defensive'` -- the base over everything else: threat reported further out, a larger detachment sent
#                      to defend it, crowding left to `SuperPolicy`.
#   * `'reactive'`  -- the default components with the damping removed.
#   * `'remote'`    -- the whole MAPE-K loop runs on the server at `MANAGING_SYSTEM_URL`. What stays here is
#                      the sensor and the effector, which are the simulation's own interface and cannot be
#                      anywhere else; every decision -- what is wrong, what to do about it, and what to
#                      remember -- is made there. See `sim/managing/remote.py`.
#
# `'local'` is still accepted, and means `'heuristic'`.
#
# This is the starting value rather than the last word: the web interface has a `Managing system` dropdown
# that overrides it for a single run, and `headless.py --managing <name>` does the same, so any two of them
# can be compared over the same seeds without editing this file.
# **Bounds:** a registered managing system name. Like `DEFAULT_UAV_POLICY` below, the name is checked when
# the managing system is built rather than here, because this file cannot import `sim/managing/` (the
# managing system imports this one).
MANAGING_SYSTEM = "heuristic"

# ### `ADAPTATION_PERIOD` -- how many simulation steps pass between runs of the MAPE-K loop.
# `1` re-evaluates the allocation every step. Larger values make the managing system slower to react but
# cheaper, which matters most with a remote managing system, where every evaluation is a round trip.
# A managing system may state its own, in which case this is what the ones that do not get.
# **Bounds:** integer `>= 1`.
ADAPTATION_PERIOD = 1

# ### `ADAPTATION_HYSTERESIS` -- consecutive evaluations that must agree before a UAV's policy is changed.
# Without it a UAV on the edge of a threshold flips policy every step and spends the run turning round
# instead of flying anywhere. `1` disables the damping and applies every decision immediately, which is
# what the `reactive` managing system does by stating its own.
# **Bounds:** integer `>= 1`.
ADAPTATION_HYSTERESIS = 2

# ### `DEFAULT_UAV_POLICY` -- the policy every UAV starts the run under, before the first adaptation.
# It is also what the managing system falls back to for a UAV it has no better idea for. Must name a policy
# registered in `sim/policy/__init__.py`; the name is checked when the model is built rather than here,
# because this file cannot import the policy package (the policy package imports this one).
# **Bounds:** a registered policy name.
DEFAULT_UAV_POLICY = "firefighter"

# ### `BASE_SENSOR_RADIUS` -- how far around the home base the managing system sees the ground truth.
# The rest of what it is told comes from the UAVs themselves, so it is as partially sighted as they are.
# The base is the one thing it must never be blind to, so it is modelled as having a fire sensor of its own
# covering this many cells beyond its footprint.
# **Bounds:** integer `>= 0`. `0` leaves the managing system with nothing but the UAV reports.
BASE_SENSOR_RADIUS = 6

# ### `BASE_THREAT_RADIUS` -- how close fire has to get to the base before it counts as threatening it.
# Fire within this distance of the footprint raises the threat level, which is what makes the managing
# system pull UAVs off the open fire and onto `defend-base`.
# **Bounds:** integer `>= 1`.
BASE_THREAT_RADIUS = 10

# ### `MANAGING_CROWDED_SPEED_CAP` -- speed a UAV is held to while it is being moved out of a crowd.
# Cheap insurance: a UAV that is already too close to a neighbour covers less ground per step, so it has
# fewer chances to end the step on top of one. Applied by `SuperPolicy`, whatever policy the UAV is flying.
# **Bounds:** integer `>= 0`, normally well below `UAV_SPEED`.
MANAGING_CROWDED_SPEED_CAP = 1

# ### `MANAGING_KNOWLEDGE_HISTORY` -- how many past snapshots the Knowledge base keeps.
# Bounded so that a long run does not grow without limit. Only the most recent few are actually consulted.
# **Bounds:** integer `>= 1`.
MANAGING_KNOWLEDGE_HISTORY = 20

# ### `MANAGING_SYSTEM_URL` -- where a remote managing system lives.
# Ignored unless the selected managing system is a remote one. The request and response format is
# documented in `sim/managing/remote.py`.
# **Bounds:** an http:// or https:// URL.
MANAGING_SYSTEM_URL = "http://127.0.0.1:8600/manage"

# ### `MANAGING_SYSTEM_TIMEOUT` -- seconds to wait for a remote managing system before giving up on it.
# A run of `BATCH_SIZE` steps at `ADAPTATION_PERIOD = 1` makes that many requests, so this bounds how long
# an unreachable server can hold a run up.
# **Bounds:** float `> 0`.
MANAGING_SYSTEM_TIMEOUT = 2.0

# ### `MANAGING_SYSTEM_FALLBACK` -- whether an unreachable remote managing system is stood in for locally.
# True runs the local loop for any evaluation the server could not answer, so a broken server costs the run
# its adaptation quality rather than its adaptation. False leaves the team on whatever it is already flying,
# which is the more honest setting for an experiment about what happens when a managing system goes away.
# **Bounds:** True or False.
MANAGING_SYSTEM_FALLBACK = True

# =====================================================================================================
# ## Colours
#
# Presentation only: these change what the web interface draws, never what the simulation does.
# **Bounds:** CSS colour strings, "#rrggbb".
#
# The map is kept light on purpose. Everything that has to be found at a glance -- the UAVs, the home base,
# the out buildings -- is drawn dark and small over a background of vegetation that covers most of the
# grid, so the darker that background is the harder those things are to pick out. The vegetation therefore
# runs from near white to a mid green rather than down into the near blacks it used to reach, and the fire
# runs from pale yellow to a bright red orange, which keeps it the most saturated thing on the map without
# it going dark either.

BASE_COLOR = "#1d4ed8"  # blue, as the home base is shown on the map
BASE_BURNING_COLOR = "#6d28d9"
# UAVs are drawn in the same near black unless COLOUR_UAVS_BY_POLICY says otherwise, which is what keeps
# them findable over the light map. The water a UAV carries is shown by how big it is drawn rather than by
# another colour: colouring the load in would mean drawing a loaded UAV in something lighter, which is what
# made it hard to find in the first place. See agent_portrayal() in sim/gui/portrayal.py.
UAV_COLOR = "#111827"  # near black, the darkest thing on the map
# also what a UAV is drawn in when its policy has no colour of its own, below

# ### `COLOUR_UAVS_BY_POLICY` -- whether a UAV is drawn in the colour of the policy it is flying.
# With a managing system running, which policy each UAV is on *is* the whole of what the managing system
# decided, and reading it off a text panel means looking away from the map to find out what the map is
# showing. Colouring the UAVs by it puts the decision where the run is being watched, and makes the
# allocation legible as a shape: a team turning red as fire closes on the base is the managing system
# working, seen at a glance.
#
# The cost is the one thing the near black was for. A colour has to be dark enough to stay findable over
# the light map, which is why the ramp below is all dark; anything lighter would undo it. Set this to False
# for the older, plainer map, where a UAV is a UAV and nothing else.
# **Bounds:** True or False.
COLOUR_UAVS_BY_POLICY = True

# ### `POLICY_COLORS` -- the colour of each policy, on the map and in the status panel's legend.
# One palette for both, so the panel doubles as the map's key. Every entry is dark enough to be picked out
# over the vegetation, and each is kept clear of what else the map draws in that hue: the fire ramp
# (yellow through red), the home base (blue), a burning base (violet), the out buildings (brown) and
# extinguished cells (cyan). A policy with no entry here is drawn in `UAV_COLOR`, so adding a policy costs
# nothing until it is worth telling apart.

# ## Validation
#
# The bounds stated against each setting above are checked here, once, at the start of a run. Without
# this an out of bounds value either runs and quietly gives nonsense, or fails much later and far from
# its cause: FIRE_SPREAD_SPEED = 0 raises ZeroDivisionError inside Fire.step(), a FUEL_BOTTOM_LIMIT above
# FUEL_UPPER_LIMIT raises ValueError once per cell out of randint(), and PROBABILITY_MAP with a UAV on
# the map throws KeyError: 'Layer' from the canvas.
#
# Only the settings whose bounds actually matter are checked; the colours and the advisory thresholds are
# left alone. WildFireModel.__init__() calls this, so it covers the web interface and the headless runner
# alike, and headless.py calls it again after applying --set overrides.

#
# A burning neighbour at offset (dx, dy) = s' - s pushes fire into s when it lies *upwind* of s, which is
